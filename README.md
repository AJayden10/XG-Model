# XG-Model
This project is a sample xg model. It collects data on a particular shot in a soccer match and determines the probability of scoring from this position based on factors like shot distance(the distance between the position the shot was taken and the target), the number of defenders between the goal and the player when taking the shot, the foot the player uses to take the shot(weaker foot or preferred foot of the player), and the position of the keeper in the pole. It then generates a single value known as the xG or expected goal value on the scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Values closer to 1.0 include a higher probability of the player to score from that scenario. This model does not account for player skill or quality. The xG from a particular position is the same for all players regardless of the level or quality of the player.
